## Active ageing

We know that people aged 65 and over are significantly less likely to be online than younger people. The internet is an important way – increasingly, the main way – of connecting to people, services and information. We need to help people in later life to get online in ways that will help them maintain their independence and social connections.

How can you do this?

1. Communications and social connections

> Solutions to make elderly people active users of technology, connecting them with their family and community, in a way that reduces isolation.

2. Serious Games

> Simple and intuitive tools and games that stimulate cognitive abilities and promote autonomy in daily life tasks. 

3. Caregivers and ageing in place 

> Tools for remote technological monitoring and tools for assisting older people living in their homes rather than being institutionalized.

## Integration of refugees and migrants

In recent years, a refugee crisis has sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe’s shores, seeking safe harbor. Studies show that stresses of climate change could drive more migrants into the European Union in future years. Tech projects can have a long-term impact on refugees and displaced people by empowering these populations.

How can you do this?

1. Internet for all

> Solutions that allow greater connectivity and access to the internet and technology whether on refugee camps or elsewhere. 

2. Inclusion

> Tools that can facilitate the social, cultural and economic integration of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in their host communities.

## Children and youth well-being

A growing body of evidence indicates that children are accessing the internet at increasingly younger ages. Smartphones are fuelling a ‘bedroom culture’, with online access for many children becoming more personal, more private and less supervised. At the same time, digital technologies are bringing opportunities for learning and education to children, especially in remote regions and during humanitarian crises.

How can you do this?

1. Learning

> Stimulating, and playful solutions that can potentiate pleasure for learning.

2. Healthy lifestyles

> Solutions that can motivate children adopting a healthier lifestyle (eating habits and physical exercise). 

3. Cyberbullying

> Technological solutions to prevent and intervene in cyberbullying incidents.
