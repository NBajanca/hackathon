## MB WAY Everywhere

![MB WAY Everywhere](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/sibs_mb-way-everywhere.jpg "MB WAY Everywhere")

## Context

MB WAY is the preferred digital wallet of the Portuguese. To challenge developers at Pixels Camp, SIBS created a set of API that will “boost MB WAY everywhere”. What does this means? With these API, you can spread the use of MB WAY payments everywhere you can think. These API allows you to deploy MB WAY payment methods in any context where you can collect a mobile phone number or display a MB WAY QR Code. 

The challenge is to use your imagination to combine this technology in all the scenarios you can think of: wherever you may need to generate a payment, now you can just use MB WAY.

These API are available through the new SIBS API Market and you can just register and start using them during the event.


## Details

**SIBS is providing 3 API in the Pixels Camp event:**


•        MB WAY ID Purchase: This API allows you to start a payment just by providing the end user phone number. The client just needs to provide its mobile phone number (which is enrolled in MB WAY) to initiate the payment. This method was mainly used in ecommerce like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lR8YDZz30g. 

•        MB WAY QR Code Purchase: This API allows you to deploy MB WAY QR Codes. Wherever you can generate a QR Code, MB WAY app can scan it to authorize payments. Once clients accept the payment in the app, the purchase is confirmed. Nowadays we are deploying it on regular POS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLsFucHQKP8) but it can be all over the places. Just imagine where you can provide QR Codes to generate purchases. Sky is the limit or maybe not, if you can show a QR Code in the sky!

•        MB WAY ID Information: This API checks if a given phone number is enrolled in MB WAY. You can use it to help creating a better experience for your end users.


During the Pixels Camp, SIBS will provide a dedicated MB WAY App for testing so you can complete payments in a test environment and don’t have to worry about spending money.
