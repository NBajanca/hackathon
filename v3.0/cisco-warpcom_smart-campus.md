![Smart Campus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/cisco-warpcom_smart-campus.jpg "Smart Campus")

## Context

Every day new innovations are released in the technology world. 
In our schools and universities, we are learning all these fancy new discoveries, but we do it with outdated technologies. 
What if we told you that changing this is in your hands?

Take Wi-Fi for instance, what if you could check wich study room has an empty sit just for you? And if the school library or bar could advertise special events when you're passing by? You wouldn't lose a happy hour anymore!

Imagine if you could rewind the class and Ctrl-F what you're looking for. And how would your school campus experience be enhanced if you could see the professor notes anywhere, in real time, and in any device?

If you could, what would you change on your school campus experience?
Warpdev and Cisco DevNet are committed to supporting you in this path. Discover all the APIs around Wi-Fi and collaboration solutions and develop with the interactive boards and the Wi-Fi access points that we've brought to Pixels!

## Details

(working on it, will send you asap!)
