## Context

Consumer activity is generating more and more data in more and more moments and situations. It is estimated that over 50 zetabytes of new data will be generated until 2020. 

Organizations are increasingly aware of the profusion of data they have in their operating systems.

Most raw data does not provide a relevant value in its raw state. However, when worked on, contextualized and analyzed, it translates into value, allowing for insights that are relevant to their decision-making processes, either at a more tactical level or for integration into their strategic planning processes.

In a world, more connected than ever, the data generation is increasing significantly, showing potential for an exponential growth in value, allowing new perspectives and new insights.
The usage of mobile devices, smartphones, connected wearables, etc, is becoming increasingly widespread, enabling the analysis of relevant information from its users. We are now able to measure behaviours, paths or flows of people by treating and analyzing mobile network data.

*Challenge 1*

Development of an Origin-Destination Matrix using a sample of mobile network data
Origin-Destination (O-D) Matrices describe people movement in a certain area. An O-D matrix is necessary, for instance, to plan a good public transportation system. The Origin-Destination matrix is a matrix where each cell represents the number of trips from origin to the destination. There are several ways to estimate the Origin-Destination matrix. We invite you to grab the challenge to produce a bullet proof O-D matrix with the sample of mobile network data provided.


*Challenge 2*

Inference of demographic attributes using a sample of mobile network data
Mobile phone usage provides a wealth of information, which can be used to better understand the demographic structure of a population. It is possible to detect significant differences in phone usage among different subgroups of the population. The challenge consists in predicting demographic features, at least age and gender, by treating and analyzing the samples of mobile network data provided.

There are many papers online that you can find to help you with these challenges. Feel free to add to your analysis any other open data that you may find. 
We are waiting for you to wow us by presenting your result in the most appealing way.
