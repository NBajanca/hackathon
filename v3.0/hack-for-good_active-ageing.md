## Context

We know that people aged 65 and over are significantly less likely to be online than younger people. The internet is an important way – increasingly, the main way – of connecting to people, services and information. We need to help people in later life to get online in ways that will help them maintain their independence and social connections.

## Details

How can you do this?


Communications and social connections

Solutions to make elderly people active users of technology, connecting them with their family and community, in a way that reduces isolation.

Serious Games

Simple and intuitive tools and games that stimulate cognitive abilities and promote autonomy in daily life tasks.

Caregivers and ageing in place

Tools for remote technological monitoring and tools for assisting older people living in their homes rather than being institutionalized.
