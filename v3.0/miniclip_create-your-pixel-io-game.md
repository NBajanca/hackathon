Hello all.
On Thursday, Friday and Saturday (21 - 23 March 2019), we want to run Pixels Camp v3.0!
â3 days of non-stop tech, talks, workshops and a 48-hour programming competitionâ

The main objective is to build up your on own casual, multiplayer, fun, game.
If anyone has any questions regarding what constitutes this event, please check the following guidelines:

Core:
Multiplayer Player vs Player  or Player versus environment
Rooms âArenasâ capable of holding all the players in a balanced and fair manner 
Simple/casual immediate gameplay:
Simple controls needing no tutorial
Simple core mechanic (like shooting, eating, pushing)
Nice to have:
Respawn in the same room when you die
Scoreboards
Some progression/ evolution within a âlifeâ (like growing, bigger guns)
Thanks
